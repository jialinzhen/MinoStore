1. npm install --save react-router-dom
2. import {BrowserRouter} from RRD and wrap it with index.js or app.js
3. Direct Routing: Import { Route } and set <Route path="..." component={...} >
4. Direct Linking: Import Link/NavLink(for accessing its 'active' class for CSS styling)
   from RRD and wrap element to provide links
    <Link to="/component">
        <SomeComponent />
    </Link>
5. use Switch to make sure only one page is rendered (prevent multi-page-routing
   due to prefix)
6. Dynamic Routing: Let say we have <Route '/someComponent/:compid' component={SomeComp}/>
   In SomeComp, we can access the id using this.props.match.params.compid,
   if we have multiple SomeComp that have different id and content, we can
   access the content by setting search="?content=" + comComp.content on Link to the one
   SomeComp, then run search param on the SomeComp page and render it dynamically
