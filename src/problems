1. Disable add to Cart -> cannot disable as adding a state variable will disable 
   "Add to Cart" for all goods.
Solution: All of your goods are handled by a single Goods component, try to have
          a modal that will always show up and prevent you from adding to the cart
          if GoodQuantity = 0, <modal show={true}/> will appear on the page rather
          than disable a particular button, also GoodQuantity-- will not get
          executed 
2. When page refreshed, "Current Avaliable Quantity" set back to database setting
Solution: when page refreshed, you are fetching data from the database and reset your
          UI, you have to update your database "registerInfo.json" when you finish 
          adding item to cart
3. When click on one item on a cart, all same items disappeared
Solution: 1) Have same item only appear once and increment the count, when count = 0,
             remove the item.
          2) change the id everytime you add the same item, (maybe doable)

Once problem done:
1) Add styling to details page
2) redux + authentication
3) personal user page
